## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project provides a way to store immunization records online instead of relying on the paper cards provided by health clinics. Within this site, a parent/guardian, administrator, or verified user can create a personal account, update vaccination information, track their individual children's personal accounts and receive informative data about immunizations they might be interested in. This is a beneficial method of storing important immunization data for families to shift from paper to paperless. Currently, vaccination forms can be multiple, disorganized and even lost for important situations. With this project, users can shift into a functional site that stores important information for them.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page, where they can add a child and vaccination data. Users can be a parent, guardian or anyone over 18 years old. 
Search/Add: Users will be able to add vaccinations to each child profile and receive information of the specific shot such as dosage, description and average age to receive.
Create Post: Users will be able to create a profile for each child when logged in. Each child profile will appear in the userâ€™s profile.
